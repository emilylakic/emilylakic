# [Hackers vs. Harassment](http://hackersvsharassment.github.io/)

[Hackers vs. Harassment](https://github.com/hackersvsharassment/hackersvsharassment.github.io) is a website which explains what bullying is and how to prevent it. The website incorporates a survey, which records and displays results through the use of pie charts. Hackers vs. Harassment was created by [Emily Lakic] (https://www.github.com/emilylakic) and [Mark Caldropoli] (https://www.github.com/markcaldropoli) and won the award for **Best Hack Against Harassment**.

### How We Built It

We built our website using **Bootstrap**, **HTML**, **Javascript** and **CSS**. In order to record the data from the survey, we used **Python**, **Flask** and **JSON** to convert the data to be used within the pie charts displayed on the website.

### Challenges We Ran Into

We encountered difficulties with time constraints, converting data taken from the survey and sending it back to the website in the form of pie charts. However, we are working on this and are hoping to be done as soon as possible. 

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 

We are proud that we were able to further our skills in Python and web development.

### What We Learned

In the beginning, we thought Python could just as easily be linked into HTML as an external stylesheet just like CSS. We were very wrong. After talking to other students and mentors at HackAE, we learned more about how to actually incorporate Python into web development. We converted our Python survey into an HTML survey after realizing that we could not add Python directly into HTML. It was a great learning experience, and a gateway to learning more about how to incorporate Pythong into an HTML file in its endless ways.
