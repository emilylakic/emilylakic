  <p id="header">About</p>
  <h2>Hi! My name is Emily Lakic</h2>
  <div id="description">I'm from Westchester, New York and am currently a rising freshman at <span id="font">Binghamton University</span>. My <span id="font">interests</span>
  include computer science, biology, mathematics, photography and basketball. My <span id="font">goal</span> was to hardcode my own website in order to showcase 
  some of my photographs in an effort to both practice my <span id="font">programming</span> skills as well as continue my interest in <span id="font">photography</span>. I shoot 
  with a <span id="font">Nikon D3100</span>, and currently photograph various things. I'm open to any inquires at the links below. 
  <span id="XO">XOX, Em</span></div>
