  <h2>Hi! My name is Emily Lakic</h2>
  <div id="description">I'm from Westchester, New York and am currently a rising Freshman at <div style="font-family:Times";>Binghamton University</div>. My <div id="font">interests</div>
  include computer science, biology, mathematics, photography and basketball. I <div id="font">aspired</div> to hardcode my own website to showcase some of my photographs in an effort
  to both practice my programming skills as well as continue my interest in photography. I shoot with a <div id="font">Nikon D3100</div>, and currently photograph
  various things. I'm open to any inquires at the links below. <div id="last">XOX, Em</div></div>
