  <span class="text">Hi! My name is Emily Lakic</p>
  <span>I'm from Westchester, New York and am currently a rising Freshman at Binghamton University. My interests include computer science,
  biology, mathematics, photography and basketball. I aspired to hardcode my own website to showcase some of my photographs in an effort
  to both practice my programming skills as well as continue my interest in photography. I shoot with a Nikon D3100, and currently photograph
  various things. I'm open to any inquires at the links below.</span>
