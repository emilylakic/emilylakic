  <p id="header">About</p>
  <h2>Hi! My name is Emily Lakic</h2>
  <div id="description">I'm from Westchester, New York and am currently a rising freshman at <span id="font">Binghamton University</span>. My <span id="font">interests</span>
  include computer science, biology, mathematics, photography and basketball. My <span id="font">goal</span> was to hardcode my own website in order to showcase 
  some of my photographs in an effort to both practice my programming skills as well as continue my interest in photography. I shoot 
  with a <span id="font">Nikon D3100</span>, and currently photograph various things. I'm open to any inquires at the links below. 
  <span id="font">XOX, Em</span></div>
