  <p id="header">About</p>
  <h2>Hi! My name is Emily Lakic</h2>
  <div id="description">I'm from Westchester, New York and am currently a rising Freshman at <span style="font-family:Times";>Binghamton University</span>. My interests
  include computer science, biology, mathematics, photography and basketball. I aspired to hardcode my own website to showcase some of my photographs in an effort
  to both practice my programming skills as well as continue my interest in photography. I shoot with a Nikon D3100, and currently photograph
  various things. I'm open to any inquires at the links below. XOX, Em</div>
